                                Hi, my name is Shomari Taylor! I'm currently in my senior year at the University of Tennessee – Knoxville, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a focus on interdisciplinary work. I am part of the Derryberry Lab, where I am leading an independent project developing a machine learning model to detect thermoregulatory behaviors in avian species — currently zebra finches — to make behavioral analyses more scalable and reproducible across large datasets. My path into research began in an unexpected place: the gaming industry, where developing systems such as weather or NPC behavior often required studying natural processes like ecosystems, physiology, and animal behavior to replicate them digitally. Once implemented, these models became interactive environments where I could test how systems responded, refine their rules, and observe the outcomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently, my research interest has been in the realm of animal behavior. This interest first grew out of a game project where we modeled, researched, and replicated fire ant behavior. I developed a system to track ant NPC behaviors and evaluate how their interactions shifted in response to player actions. This was similar to ant research, where colonies are observed, rules at the individual level are tested, and emergent dynamics are studied. More recently, I have worked with Dr. Juan Zuluaga on his postdoctoral project, where I have been gaining hands-on experience with respirometry, physiology, and thermal imaging. Building on these experiences, I want to investigate how emerging technologies can be used to better understand the ways animals employ behavior and other adaptive strategies in response to a changing environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of research, I care about making education accessible. I've spent time tutoring at Kirby Elementary, Middle, and High, where the best part for me has been helping students connect what they're curious about to real possibilities for their futures. One of my favorite experiences was over the summer when I taught a group of students about how being a digital artist can overlap with careers that use programs like AutoCAD. We talked about how the same creative skills they use for art could also be applied in engineering, design, and architecture. At UTK, I help out with events for the Computational Biology Club, where we try to highlight the overlaps between computer science and biology. I like finding ways to make those connections feel approachable and maybe get people curious about something new.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm currently looking for Master's programs for Fall 2026. I'm also interested in job opportunities in labs where I can keep building my skills and contribute to ongoing projects. What excites me most is exploring the intersection of computer science and biology, especially how tools like agent-based modeling, machine learning, and thermal imaging can open new ways of understanding how organisms function and adapt. So far, most of my work has been with birds, such as zebra finches and least terns, but I'm eager to expand into other groups to see how these approaches can be applied across different taxonomic systems. If you think I'd be a good fit for your lab, or just want to connect about research, feel free to reach out to me at stayl118@vols.utk.edu
